# React Immersive Code Challenge: Bot Battlr
Welcome to Bot Battlr, a galactic web app that empowers you to build and command your very own Bot Army. As a skilled galactic web developer, My mission is to create an application that allows users to browse through a list of robots, view detailed information about each bot, and enlist them into their army. 

## Scenario

A galactic overlord has hired you for this critical mission. Your task is to develop a React application that provides a user-friendly interface for managing a Bot Army. You'll be working with a set of core deliverables and have the opportunity to tackle advanced features if time allows.
